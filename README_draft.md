## Leadership & Ways of Working

- Built cross-functional processes: model design reviews, risk assessments, incident runbooks.
- Instituted mentoring program and career ladders for ML engineers.
- Advocated reproducibility, testing, and cost-awareness at design time.
- Hires mentored: {Number — e.g., 8 engineers}; team scaling: {From X to Y}.

## How I Work (Principles)

- Data-first: prioritize data quality and observability.
- Automate: pipelines, testing, and deployment as code.
- Safe-by-design: bias checks, thresholds, rollback strategies.
- Incremental & measurable: ship small, measure, iterate.

## How to Customize This Draft

1. Replace all `{...}` placeholders with concrete names, links, and metrics.
2. For each project, add a one-line TL;DR above the details for quick scanning.
3. Add 1–2 visuals: a short architecture diagram and a 20–30s demo GIF or notebook link.
4. Optionally, shorten the Snapshot and Core Competencies to keep the top-of-file minimal (3–5 lines).
